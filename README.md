Journal for Traders

After searching the web, I cannot find a trading journal that fulfills a few basic requirements:
- Integrates with a market data connection to directly plot trades and do "what-if" analysis
- Allows intuitive logging of scale-in, scale-out trades
- Allows custom modules or plug-ins for custom analysis

With that in mind and a need to practice coding once in a while, I'm kicking off this project. Likely it'll get lost to the vacuum of the internet, but let this readme show that it was once started with admirable intentions.
